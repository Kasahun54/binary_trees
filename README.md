# C - Binary trees

Throughout the project, we
implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
This was a partner project in which we learned about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We have learned about how to
qualify trees as well as how to traverse them out.
